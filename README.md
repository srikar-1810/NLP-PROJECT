Cyberbullying Detection in Online Communities::

This project aims to automatically detect whether a text message contains cyberbullying content or not.  
The system uses NLP preprocessing, Machine Learning (SVM), Deep Learning (LSTM), and Transformers (BERT).

 Project Members::
- N. Sai Srikar [ARI079]  
- N. Greeshma [ARI080]  
- N. Likitha [ARI083]  
- K. Shruthika [ARI071]  
- G. Sahithi [MCS072]  

 Motivation::  
With the rise of social media, cyberbullying has increased.  
Manual moderation cannot keep up with the massive scale of online interactions.  
This project provides an automated system to detect harmful content.

 Pipeline::
1. Data Collection  
2. Preprocessing  
3. Feature Extraction  
4. Model Training (SVM, LSTM, BERT)  
5. Evaluation  
6. Deployment (API)
